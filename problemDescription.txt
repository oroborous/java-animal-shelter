The Pewaukee Humane Society needs an application to manage their animal shelter.

The shelter houses both dogs and cats that are available for adoption. When an animal arrives at the shelter, their name and age is recorded in the system. Cats must be tested for FIV. Patrons may browse all animals currently available and select one to adopt. When a dog or cat is adopted, it is removed from the system.
